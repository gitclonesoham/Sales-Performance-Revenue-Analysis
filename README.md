# Sales Performance & Revenue Insights

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to understand revenue trends, identify top-performing and underperforming products, and observe regional and seasonal patterns.  
The goal is to simulate real-world data analysis work using SQL and Python.

---

## Dataset

The analysis uses a retail “Superstore” sales dataset containing information about:
- Orders and order dates  
- Customers and regions  
- Product categories and sales values  

The dataset is realistic in size and structure, similar to what is commonly encountered in business analytics tasks.

## Tools & Technologies

- **PostgreSQL** – storing and querying structured sales data  
- **SQL** – data cleaning, aggregation, and trend analysis  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – exploratory data analysis and visualization

## Project Workflow

1. Loaded raw sales data into PostgreSQL using Python  
2. Cleaned and standardized the data (dates, columns, formats)  
3. Used SQL queries to analyze:
   - Revenue by region  
   - Top revenue-generating products  
   - Loss-making products  
   - Monthly sales trends  
4. Performed exploratory analysis in Python to visualize revenue patterns  
5. Summarized insights in a business-focused manner

## Key Insights

- Revenue is concentrated in a limited number of high-performing products  
- Some products consistently generate losses despite strong sales volumes  
- Clear seasonal patterns are visible in monthly revenue trends  
- Regional performance varies significantly, indicating different market behaviors

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, from data ingestion and cleaning to SQL-based analysis and visualization.  
It reflects common tasks performed by data analysts when working with real business datasets.
